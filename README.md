This is a web application I built using the py4web.py web development framework. I used pydal.py to communicate with the database, and vue.js to build the web app. The applications allows users to log in and make posts on a message board. Users have the ability to edit, delete, create, or reply to posts. Posts can also be liked so that they go to the top of the users feed.
